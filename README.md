# Used Car Price Prediction App  
This repository contains a **Used Car Price Prediction App** built using **Streamlit**. It is a **proof of concept (POC)** project designed to showcase your ability to build predictive models and deploy them using an interactive web interface.  

The application leverages a **Linear Regression model** trained on the **Cars24 dataset** to predict the price of used cars based on key features.

## Repository Structure  
The repository includes the following files:  
- `.gitattributes` – Maintains consistent behavior across platforms for text files in the repository.  
- `.gitignore` – Specifies files and directories to be excluded from Git tracking.  
- `CarPrice.py` – Python script for model training using Linear Regression.  
- `README.md` – Documentation for the project.  
- `Stock_Market_App.py` – An experimental app file (not relevant to the car price prediction app).  
- `app.py` – Main Streamlit application for the Used Car Price Predictor.  
- `car_pred` – Serialized Linear Regression model stored as a pickle file.  
- `cars24.csv` – Dataset used to train the model.  
- `requirements.txt` – List of Python dependencies required to run the app.

## About the App  

### Description  
The **Used Car Price Predictor App** enables users to predict the selling price of a used car based on its specifications. It uses a **Linear Regression model** trained on a subset of the Cars24 dataset. The model uses **four key variables** for prediction:  
- **Fuel Type**: Type of fuel used by the car (e.g., Petrol, Diesel, etc.).  
- **Transmission Type**: Gear system type (e.g., Manual, Automatic).  
- **Engine**: Engine capacity (e.g., 1197cc, 1498cc).  
- **Seats**: Number of seats in the car.  

All other features are predefined constants for simplicity in this POC.  

---

### Features  
1. **Simple User Interface**  
   - The app has an intuitive UI built using Streamlit, making it accessible to non-technical users.  

2. **Dynamic Predictions**  
   - Based on the user inputs for fuel type, transmission type, engine size, and seats, the app predicts the price of the car.  

3. **Machine Learning Model**  
   - A **Linear Regression model** was trained on the Cars24 dataset and serialized for deployment.  

---

### How It Works  

1. **Dataset**  
   The `cars24.csv` file contains data on used cars, including features like fuel type, engine capacity, and transmission type.  

2. **Model Training**  
   The `CarPrice.py` script processes the dataset, trains a Linear Regression model using the following features:  
   - Fuel Type  
   - Transmission Type  
   - Engine Capacity  
   - Number of Seats  

3. **Model Deployment**  
   The trained model is stored as a `.pkl` file (`car_pred`) and integrated into the Streamlit app (`app.py`).  

4. **User Interaction**  
   - Users can input values for the four predictors via the app interface.  
   - The app calculates and displays the estimated car price.

## Installation and Usage  

### Prerequisites  
- Python 3.8 or higher  
- Pip (Python package manager)  

### Installation  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Price-prediction-using-streamlit.git  
   cd Price-prediction-using-streamlit  
   ```  

2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```  

3. Run the Streamlit app:  
   ```bash  
   streamlit run app.py  
   ```  

4. Access the app in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

## Example Predictions  

Provide the following inputs to the app:  
- **Fuel Type**: Diesel  
- **Transmission Type**: Manual  
- **Engine**: 1498  
- **Seats**: 5  

The app will output the predicted price of the car based on the trained Linear Regression model.  

---

## Key Considerations  
- This app is a **proof of concept** and does not represent a production-ready solution.  
- The app uses predefined values for some features, limiting its flexibility.

## Future Improvements  
- Integrate additional predictors (e.g., mileage, registration year).  
- Use advanced algorithms for improved accuracy.  
- Deploy the app to a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Heroku).
